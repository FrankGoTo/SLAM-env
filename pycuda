#############提示找不到nvcc的路径　只能修改源代码#######################################
file path=/home/v100/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pycuda/compiler.py

To close the loop on this, I finally worked my way through the problem.

Note: I know this is not really a good nor permanent answer for most people however in my case I am running POC code for my dissertation and as soon as I get some final results I'm decommissioning the servers. I doubt this answer will be suitable or appropriate for most users.

I ended up hardcoding the full path to nvcc into compile_plain() in Pycuda's compiler.py file.

Partial listing:

def compile_plain(source, options, keep, nvcc, cache_dir, target="cubin"):
    from os.path import join

    assert target in ["cubin", "ptx", "fatbin"]
    nvcc = '/usr/local/cuda/bin/'+nvcc
    if cache_dir:
        checksum = _new_md5()
Hopefully this points someone else in the proper direction.
